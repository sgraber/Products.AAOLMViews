        Products.AAOLMViews
        
        Custom Plone views for Advanced Aquarist's Online Magazine
        (Based on Scrawl 1.3.1)
        
        Description
        ===========
        
        This product is a heavy customization of the codebase that is used for Scrawl,
        a "dirt-simple blog product for Plone."  The codebase was chosen as it easily 
        made custom views available to different content items.  
        
        Products.AAOLMViews creates custom views for primarily Topics along with 
        News Items and Links. It also creates template over-rides to Documents (Pages) 
        and Events.  Below are the views that are registered / customized:
        
        Topics (new views):
        * Blog Listing - lists items like a blog
        * Magazine Issue Table of Contents
        * Events Listing that uses Simile Timeline + Google Maps to visualize Events
        
        Folders (new view):
        * Slideshow for Photos
        
        News Items (new views):
        * Blog Entry (see note)
        
        Links (new views):
        * Video View - links to YouTube, Vimeo, etc show up as Videos
        
        Events (customized):
        * Added Google Map + Map Link for driving directions
        
        Pages (customized):
        * Contributors are now listed as Authors
        * Uses typogrify and smartypants for pretty markup
        
        
        This product, like Scrawl, works in Plone 2.1, 2.5, 3.x, and 4.0.
        
        Note: Blog Entry shows either the description of each contained blog entry 
        (if it exists) or the entire body in it, so it's up to the user to limit those 
        results in an intelligent way so that page loads doesn't take too long.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The installer registers a new skins folder, aaolm_views, and adds the 
        appropriate new views to Topics, News Items, Links, Events, and Pages. The new
        views are then available from the appropriate content types and can be selected
        from the view dropdown list on that content type. Upon uninstallation, the new 
        views are unregistered from all of the appropriate content types and any content
        that uses one of the unregistered views is reset to its appropriate default 
        template.
